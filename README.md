# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

This repository contains Java solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. I use this repo to track my progress as I solve different DSA problems in Java. Each problem is implemented as a separate `.java` file, and the code is well-documented to help understand the logic and approach used to solve the problem.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- Each Java file corresponds to a specific DSA problem.
- The file name indicates the problem being solved.
- Problems cover a variety of topics, including:
  - Linked Lists
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  - Trees
  - Recursion
  - Linked List
  - Sorting and Searching
  - Map
  - Set
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Graphs
  - Miscellaneous Algorithms

## Getting Started
To run any of the solutions:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mayappa123/DSA.git

2. Navigate to the DSA directory:

   ```bash
   cd DSA

3. Compile and run the desired Java file using the following commands:

   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName

4. Replace FileName with the actual name of the Java file you want to run.
